\item Pick's Theorem:

\begin{itemize}
    \item If a polygon has vertices with integer coordinates (lattice points), then the area is given by:
    \[
    \text{Area}(P) = i + \frac{1}{2}p - 1
    \]
    where \(i\) is the number of lattice points inside the polygon, and \(p\) is the number of lattice points on the perimeter of the polygon.
\end{itemize}
